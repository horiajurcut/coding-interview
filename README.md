# Cracking The Coding Interview

## The Interview Process

This section offers an overview on questions are selected and how you will be evaluated. What happens when you get a question wrong? When should you start preparing, and how? What language should you use? All these questions and more are answered.

- [X] Why?
- [X] How Questions are Selected
- [X] It's All Relative
- [X] Frequently Asked Questions

## Behind the Scenes

Learn what happens behind the scenes during your interview, how decisions really get made, who you interview with, and what they ask you. Companies covered include Google, Amazon, Palantir, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook.

- [X] Building a Network
- [X] Preparation Map

## Behavioral Preparation

Although most of a software engineering interview will be technical, behavioral questions matter too. This section covers how to prepare for behavioral questions and how to give strong, structured responses.

- [X] Interview Preparation Grid
- [X] Know Your Technical Projects
- [X] Responding to Behavioral Projects
- [X] So, tell me about yourself

## Big O

This is a critical topic for an interview. In order to optimize your solution, you need to be able to discuss the efficiency of your algorithm.
