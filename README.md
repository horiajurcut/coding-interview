## Before the Interview

In order to ace the interview, you first need to get an interview. This section describes what a software engineer's resume should look like and what you should be doing well before your interview.

- [ ] Getting the Right Experience
- [ ] Building a Network
- [ ] Preparation Map

## Behavioral Preparation

Although most of a software engineering interview will be technical, behavioral questions matter too. This section covers how to prepare for behavioral questions and how to give strong, structured responses.

- [ ] Interview Preparation Grid
- [ ] Know Your Technical Projects
- [ ] Responding to Behavioral Projects
- [ ] So, tell me about yourself

## Big O

This is a critical topic for an interview. In order to optimize your solution, you need to be able to discuss the efficiency of your algorithm.
